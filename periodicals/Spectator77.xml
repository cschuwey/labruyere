        <p>Our digital edition explores the connections between La Bruyère’s portrait of Ménalque,
          the absent-minded man, and Eustace Budgell’s essay on Will Honeycombe, which appears in
          Addison and Steele’s Spectator issue number 77, originally published May 29, 1711.</p>

        <p> This digital edition describes a microfilm of the Spectator issue number 77 (May 29,
          1711), courtesy of the British Periodical Digital Collection at the New York Public
          Library, as well as selected text from the ninth and final edition of Les Caractères by La
          Bruyère‎. We have chosen to mark-up the periodical in its original context, including
          headings, notations, and advertisements. Due to its inclusion of character keys that
          correspond with the French keys, we also reference editorial materials from the 1891 bound
          edition of the Spectator, edited by Henry Morley and published by Routledge and Sons.</p>

      <p>My friend <persName rend="sc">WILL. HONEYCOMBE</persName> is one of those Sort of Men who
        are very often absent in Conversation, and what the French call <foreign xml:lang="fr"
          rend="italics">a reveur</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italics">a
          distrait</foreign>. A little before our Club-time last Night, we were walking together in
            <placeName><hi rend="italics">Somerset</hi> Garden</placeName>, where <persName
          rend="sc">WILL</persName> had picked up a small Pebble of so odd a make, that he said he
        would present it to a Friend of his, an eminent Virtuoso. After we had walked some time, I
        made a full stop with my Face towards the West, which <persName rend="sc">WILL</persName>.
        knowing to be my usual Method of asking what's o'Clock, in an Afternoon, immediately pulled
        out his Watch, and told me we had seven Minutes good. We took a turn or two more, when, to
        my great Surprize I saw him squirr away his Watch a considerable way into the <placeName
          rend="italics">Thames</placeName>, and with great Sedateness in his Looks put up the
        Pebble, he had before found, in his fob. As I have naturally an Aversion to much Speaking,
        and do not love to be the Messenger of Ill News, especially when it comes too late to be
        useful, I left him to be convinced of his mistake in due time, and continued my Walk,
        reflecting on these little Absences and Distractions in Mankind, and resolving to make them
        the Subject of a future Speculation.</p>

      <p>I was the more confirmed in my Design, when I considered that they were very often
        Blemishes in the Characters of Men of Excellent Sense; and helped to keep up the Reputation
        of that <hi rend="italics">Latin</hi> proverb, which Mr. <persName rend="italics"
          >Dryden</persName> has Translated in the following Lines:</p>

      <p><quote type="translation" rend="italics"><l>Great Wit to Madness Sure is near ally'd,</l>
          <l>And thin Partitions do their Bounds divide.</l></quote></p>

      <p>My reader does, I hope, perceive, that I distinguish a man who is <hi rend="italics"
          >Absent</hi>, because he thinks of something else, from one who is <hi rend="italics"
          >Absent</hi> because he thinks of nothing at all: The latter is too Innocent a Creature to
        be taken notice of; but the Distractions of the former may, I believe, be generally
        accounted for from one of these Reasons.</p>

      <p>Either their Minds are wholly fixed on some particular Science, which is often the Case of
        Mathematicians and other Learned Men; or are wholly taken up with some violent Passion, such
        as Anger, Fear, or Love, which ties the Mind to some distant Object; or, lastly, these
        Distractions proceed from a certain Vivacity and Fickleness in a Man's Temper, which, while
        it raises up infinite Numbers of <hi rend="italics">Idea</hi>'s in the Mind, is continually
        pushing it on, without allowing it to rest on any particular Image. Nothing therefore is
        more unnatural than the <cb/> Thoughts and Conceptions of such a Man, which are seldom
        occasioned either by the Company he is in, or any of those Objects which are placed before
        him. While you fancy he is Admiring a Beautiful Woman, 'tis an even Wager that he is solving
        a Proposition in <persName rend="italics">Euclid</persName>; and while you may imagine he is
        reading the <name rend="italics">Paris Gazette</name>, 'tis far from being impossible that
        he is pulling down and rebuilding the Front of his Country-House.</p>

      <p>At the same time that I am endeavouring to expose this Weakness in others, I shall readily
        confess that I once laboured under the same Infirmity my self. The Method I took to Conquer
        it was a firm Resolution to learn something from whatever I was obliged to see or hear.
        There is a way of Thinking, if a Man can attain to it, by which he may strike somewhat out
        of any thing. I can at present observe those Starts of good Sense and Struggles of
        unimproved Reason in the Conversation of a Clown, with as much Satisfaction as the most
        shining Periods of the most finished Orator; and can make a shift to command my Attention at
        a <hi rend="italics">Puppet-Show</hi> or an <hi rend="italics">Opera</hi>, as well as at
          <title rend="italics">Hamlet</title> or <title rend="italics">Othello</title>. I always
        make one of the Company I am in; for though I say little myself, my Attention to others, and
        those Nods of Approbation which I never bestow unmerited, sufficiently show that I am among
        them. Whereas <persName rend="sc">WILL. HONEYCOMBE</persName>, tho' a Fellow of good Sense,
        is every Day doing and saying an hundred Things, which he afterwards confesses, with a
        well-bred Frankness, were somewhat <foreign xml:lang="fr">mal a propos</foreign>, and
        undesigned.</p>

      <p>I chanced the other Day to go into a Coffee-house, where <persName rend="sc"
          >WILL.</persName> was standing in the midst of several Auditors whom he had gathered
        around him, and was giving them an Account of the Person and Character of <persName
          rend="italics">Moll Hinton</persName>. My Appearance before him just put him in mind of
        me, without making him reflect that I was actually present. So that keeping his Eyes full
        upon me, to the great Surprize of his Audience, he broke off his first Harangue, and
        proceeded thus,-—<said>Why now there's my Friend</said> (mentioning me by Name) <said>he is
          a Fellow that thinks a great deal, but never opens his Mouth; I warrant you he is now
          thrusting his short Face into some Coffee-house about '<hi rend="italics">Change</hi>. I
          was his Bail in the time of the <hi rend="italics">Popish-Plot</hi>, when he was taken up
          for a Jesuit.</said> If he had looked on me a little longer, he had certainly described me
        so particularly, without ever considering what led him into it, that the whole Company must
        necessarily have found me out; for which reason, remembering the old Proverb, <quote
          type="paraphase" rend="italics">Out of sight out of mind</quote>, I left the Room; and
        <pb/> and upon meeting him an Hour afterwards, was asked by him, with a great deal of good
        Humour, in what Part of the World I had lived, that he had not seen me these three Days.</p>

      <p><persName>Monsieur <hi rend="italics">Bruyere</hi></persName> has given us the Character of
          <hi rend="italics">an absent Man</hi>, with a great deal of Humour, which he has pushed to
        an agreeable Extravagance; with the Heads of it I shall conclude my present Paper.</p>

      <quote type="paraphrase">
        <p><persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> (says that excellent author) comes down in a
          Morning, opens his Door to go out, but shuts it again, because he perceives that he has
          his Night-cap on; and, examining himself further finds that he is but half shaved, that he
          has stuck his Sword on his right side, that his Stockings are about his Heels, and that
          his Shirt is over his Breeches. When he is dress'd, he goes to Court, comes into the
          Drawing-room, and walking bolt upright under a branch of Candlesticks his Wigg is caught
          up by one of them, and hangs dangling in the Air. All the Courtiers fall a laughing, but
            <persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> laughs louder than any of them, and looks
          about for the Person that is the Jest of the Company. Coming down to the Court-gate he
          finds a Coach, which taking for his own, he whips into it, and the Coachman drives off,
          not doubting but he carries his Master. As soon as he stops, <persName rend="italics"
            >Menalcas</persName> throws himself out of the Coach, crosses the Court, ascends the
          Stair-case, and runs thro' all the Chambers with the greatest Familiarity, reposes himself
          on a Couch, and fancies himself at home. The Master of the House at last comes in,
            <persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> rises to receive him, and desires him to
          sit down; he talks, muses, and then talks again. The Gentleman of the House is tired and
          amazed; <persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> is no less so, but is every Moment in
          hopes that his impertinent Guest will at last end his tedious Visit. Night comes on, when
            <persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> is hardly undeceived.</p>
        <p>When he is playing at Backgammon, he calls for a full Glass of Wine and Water; 'tis his
          turn to throw, he has the Box in one Hand, and his Glass in the other, and being extremely
          dry, and unwilling to lose Time, he swallows down both the Dice, and at the same time
          throws his Wine into the Tables. He writes a Letter, and flings the Sand into the
          Ink-bottle; he writes a second, and mistakes the Superscription : A Noble-man receives one
          of them, and upon opening it reads as follows. <hi rend="italics">I would have you, honest
              <persName>Jack</persName>, immediately on the Receipt of this, take in Hay enough to
            serve me the Winter</hi>. His farmer receives the other, and is amazed to see in it, <hi
            rend="italics">My lord, I received your Grace's Commands, with an intire Submission
            to</hi>-- If he is at an Entertainment, you may see the Pieces of Bread continually
          multiplying around his Plate: 'Tis true the rest of the Company want it, as well as their
          Knives and Forks, which <persName rend="italics">Menalcas</persName> does not let them
          keep long. Sometimes in a Morning he puts his whole Family in a hurry, and at last goes
          out without being able to stay for his Coach or Dinner; and for that Day you may see him
          in every part of the Town, except the very Place where he had appointed to be upon a
          Business of Importance. You would often take him for every thing that he is not; for a
          Fellow quite Stupid, for he hears no- ' thing; for a Fool, for he talks to himself, and
          has <cb/> an hundred Grimaces and Motions with his Head, which are altogether involuntary;
          for a proud Man, for he looks full upon you, and takes no notice of your Saluting him: The
          Truth on't is, his Eyes are open, but he makes no use of them, and neither sees you, nor
          any Man, nor any thing else. He came once from his Country-house, and his own Footmen
          undertook to rob him, and succeeded; They held a Flambeau to his Throat, and bid him
          deliver his Purse; he did so, and coming home told his Friends he had been robbed; they
          desired to know the Particulars. <said>Ask my Servants</said>, says <persName
