While others, with a great deal of <span class="case(mixed)">Reason</span> , made me apprehend the capriciousness of the <span class="case(smallcaps)">multitude</span> , and the levity of the <span class="case(mixed)">People</span> , (with whom, however, I have good cause to be content.)</p><p>These were always suggesting to me, that for these thirty years past, few have read with any other intent, than for the sake of reading, and that to amuse the <span class="case(mixed)">World</span> , there ought to be new <span class="case(smallcaps)">chapters</span> and a new <span class="case(smallcaps)">title</span> <span class="note" id="Note13"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">,</span> <span class="gloss">.</span></span> That this humour of indifference had <span class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">fill'd</span> <span class="gloss">filled</span></span> the <span class="case(smallcaps)">shops</span> , and stockt the <span class="case(smallcaps)">age</span> with piles of dull and tedious <span class="case(mixed)">Books</span> , without <span class="case(smallcaps)">stile</span> or <span class="case(smallcaps)">meaning</span> , <span class="case(smallcaps)">rules</span> or <span class="case(smallcaps)">order</span> , contrary to <span class="case(mixed)">Decency</span> or <span class="case(mixed)">Manners</span> , written in haste, read with precipitation, and only read for their <span class="case(smallcaps)">novelty</span> . They added farther, if I could not enlarge a sensible <span class="case(mixed)">Book</span> , I had best sit still, and do nothing.</p><p>I in some measure took both their <span class="case(smallcaps)">advices</span> , as opposite as they <span class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">seem’d</span> <span class="gloss">seemed</span></span> to be, and <span class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">observ’d</span> <span class="gloss">observed</span></span> a medium which disagreed with neither. I did not scruple to add some new <span class="case(smallcaps)">remarks</span> , to those which already had doubled the bulk of the first <span class="case(smallcaps)">edition</span> of my <span class="case(mixed)">Book</span> , but that the <span class="case(mixed)">Publick</span> might not be <span class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">oblig’d</span> <span class="gloss">obliged</span></span> to read over what was done before, to come at what has been added since, and that they might immediately find out what they would only read, I took care to distinguish the second augmentation by a greater mark, and the first by a less, as well to shew the progress of my <span class="title">Characters</span> , as to guide the <span class="case(mixed)">Reader</span> in the choice he might be willing to make.</p><p>And lest he should be afraid that I <span class="note" id="Note18"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">shou'd</span> <span class="gloss">should</span></span> never have done with these <span class="case(mixed)">Additions</span> , I added to all my exactness, the sincere promise to venture on nothing more of this kind. If any one accuses me with breaking my word, by adding in the three ensuing <span class="case(mixed)">Editions</span> a great many new <span class="case(mixed)">Remarks</span> , I confess ingenuously I had not the power to suppress 'em.</p><p>He may perceive, by mingling what was new with what was old, without any mark of distinction, I did not so much endeavour to entertain the <span class="case(mixed)">World</span> with <span class="case(smallcaps)">novelties</span> , as to deliver down to <span class="case(mixed)">Posterity</span> , a <span class="case(mixed)">Book</span> of <span class="case(mixed)">Manners</span> , more pure, regular and compleat.</p><p>To conclude, what I have written are not <span class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="term">design'ed</span> <span class="gloss">designed</span></span> for maxims; those are like <span class="case(mixed)">Laws</span> in <span class="case(mixed)">Morality</span> , and I have neither <span class="case(mixed)">Genius</span> nor <span class="case(mixed)">Authority</span> sufficient to qualifie me for a <span class="case(mixed)">Legislator</span> .
