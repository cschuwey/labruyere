               . The

               <!--I have introduce the parenthesis to help focus the reader on the main idea contain in the sentence but also to highlight the author's comment-->,
               it may at leisure correct them. This is what a 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Man</hi>
               ought chiefly to propose to
               himself in 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Writing</hi>
               , tho he can’t always be sure of

            </p>
            <p> However, as long as Men distaste Vice so little as they do, we should never give
               over reproaching them. (I have replaced : with .) They would perhaps be worse, were

               and 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">reproof</hi>
               , which makes 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Writing</hi>
               and
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Preaching </hi>
               of absolute necessity. The 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Orator</hi>
               and 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Writer</hi> can’t stifle the 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">joy</hi>
               they feel when they are applauded, but they ought to blush in themselves, if they aim at nothing more than

               we should advance, the more insinuating, and the better received(instead of

               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Minds</hi>
               , and render them more attentive on what is to follow,

               (eliminate comma)(whom we must by no means neglect) both the

               obliges me to request may not be forgot, that is, always to have my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Title</hi>
               in view,
               and to think, as often as this
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi>
               is read, that I describe 
               <hi rend="italics">the Characters, or Manners of the Age</hi>
               .(eliminate semicollon). For tho I frequently take 'em from the court of 
               <hi rend="italics"> France</hi>
               , and 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Men</hi>
               of my own

               , yet they cannot be confined (instead of confin'd) to any one 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">court</hi>
               or
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)"> country</hi>
               , without losing a great deal of the compass and usefulness of my
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi>
               , and destroying the design of the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Work</hi>
               , which is to paint 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Mankind</hi>
               in general, as the order of the 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">chapters</hi>
               , and a certain insensible connexion, which the
               reflexions that compose them, have one with another, do plainly demonstrate. 
            </p>
            <p> After this so necessary a precaution, the consequences of which ‘tis easie enough

               has a right to

               of his

               . 
            </p>
            <p> I confess, from the year 1690 and before the publishing the 5th 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Edition</hi>
               , I was divided between an 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">impatience</hi>
               , to give my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi> another

               , and a fear left some <hi rend="case(mixed)">People</hi>
               should say: instead of , 
               Will these

               pleasant, inexhaustible; live long, and treat on’t without interruptions as long as
               you live: What can you do better?

            <p> The 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">follies</hi>
               of 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Mankind</hi>
               will every year furnish you with a 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Volume</hi>
               . While
               others, with a great deal of 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Reason</hi>
               , made me apprehend the capriciousness of the
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)"> multitude</hi>
               , and the levity of the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">People</hi>
               , (with whom, however, I have good cause to be content.) 
            </p>
            <p> These were always suggesting to me, that for these thirty years past, few have read
               with any other intent, than for the sake of reading, and that to amuse the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">World</hi>
               , there ought to be new 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">chapters</hi>
               and a new 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">title</hi>
               . (; with.) That this humour of indifference had (changed from fill'd to filled) filled the 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">shops</hi>
               , and stockt the 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">age</hi>
               with piles of dull and tedious 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Books</hi>
               , without 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">stile</hi>
               or 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">meaning</hi>
               , 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">rules</hi>
               or 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">order</hi>
               , contrary to 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Decency</hi>
               or 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Manners</hi>
               , written in haste, read with precipitation, and only read for their 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">novelty</hi>
               . They added farther, if I could not enlarge a sensible 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi>
               , I had best sit still, and do nothing. 
            </p>
            <p> I in some measure took both their 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">advices</hi>
               , as opposite as they seemed (instead of seem’d) to be, and observed (instead of observ’d) a medium which
               disagreed with neither. I did not scruple to add some new 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">remarks</hi>
               , to those which already had doubled the bulk of the first 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">edition</hi>
               of my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi>
               , but that the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Publick</hi>
               might not be obliged (instead of oblig’d) to read over what was done
               before, to come at what has been added since, and that they might immediately find
               out what they would only read, I took care to distinguish the second augmentation by
               a greater mark, and the first by a less, as well to shew the progress of my
               <hi rend="title">Characters</hi>
               , as to guide the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Reader</hi>
               in the choice he might be willing to make. 
            </p>
            <p> And lest he should be afraid that I should (instead of shou'd) never have done with
               these 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Additions</hi>
               , I added to all my exactness, the sincere promise to venture on
               nothing more of this kind. If any one accuses me with breaking my word, by adding in
               the three ensuing 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Editions</hi>
               a great many new 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Remarks</hi>
               , I confess ingenuously I had not
               the power to suppress 'em. 
            </p>
            <p> He may perceive, by mingling what was new with what was old, without any mark of
               distinction, I did not so much endeavour to entertain the 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">World</hi>
               with 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">novelties</hi>
               , as to deliver down to 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Posterity</hi>
               , a 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Book</hi>
               of 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Manners</hi>
               , more pure, regular and compleat. 
            </p>
            <p> To conclude, what I have written are not designed (instead of design'ed) for maxims;
               those are like 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Laws</hi>
               in 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Morality</hi>
               , and I have neither
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">genius</hi>
               nor 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Authority</hi>
               sufficient to qualifie me for a 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Legislator</hi>
               . I know well enough, I have offended against the 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">custom</hi>
               of writing 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Maxims</hi>
               , which are delivered (instead of deliver'd) in short and concise 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">terms</hi>
               , like the manner of 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Oracles</hi>
               . 
            </p>
            <p> Some of my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Remarks</hi>
               are of this kind, others are more extended. We think of things
               differently, and we express 'em in a turn altogether as different: By a 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">sentence</hi>
               , an (

               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">metaphor</hi>
               , or some other 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">figure</hi>
               , a
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)"> parallel</hi>
               , a simple comparison, by a story at length, or a single 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">passage</hi>
               , by a 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">description</hi>
               or a 
               <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">picture</hi>
               , from whence proceeds the
               length or shortness of my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Reflections</hi>
               .

            <p> Those who write 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Maxims</hi>
               , would be thought infaillible; on the contrary, I allow any
               body to say of me, my 
               <hi rend="case(mixed)">Remarks</hi>
               are not always good, provided he will himself makebet ter.
