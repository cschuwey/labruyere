Volume 25 of The Critical Review, Or, Annals of Literature (1768) by W. Simpkin and R. Marshall write: "To render the character of an Absent Man entertaining on the stage, much more is required, and might have been expected, from a writer than a transcript from a writer than a transcript from Bruyere: his Menalcas is a caricature from Theophrastus whose original draught itself is much less pleasing, natural, and dramatic, than the Parson Adams of our inimitable Fielding." Coversely, the 1768 The Monthly Review, or Literary Journal by Several Hands writes rather curtly: "A laughable entertainment enough." </span> This engaged the author to look over it with greater care than he had before done, and having heightened some places where he thought it most deficient, he now submits it to the public, in a form, in which, he hopes it will not utterly displease, though it is needless to say that things of this kind have their principal merit in representation.</p><p class="first-indent">Regnard one of the most famous French comic poets, ranked by his countrymen next to <span class="name">Moliere</span>, has written a play of five acts upon this subject, called, <span class="titlem">le <span class="all-caps">DISTRAIT</span></span> how ever, exclusive of their great disparity in merit; no two pieces can be less alike than that, and <span class="titlem">the <span class="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</span></span>; atleast, where the materials have been drawn from the same source. <span class="titlem">The <span class="all-caps">DISTRAIT</span></span> of Regnard is exactly the Menalcas of La Bruyere's characters, a few things only left out, which, though possessed of a pleasant extravagance in recital, would be too absurd for actual representation; the hint of <span class="name">the <span class="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</span></span>, and no more, is taken from the same character of Menalcas, translated in one of the numbers of the Spectator; with the assistance of which, if the present writer has been able to produce a laughable farce, it is all he aimed at, and he pretends to no more praise than such a trifling composition may deserve.</p></div>P R O L O G U E.<span class="italics">Written by the</span> <span class="all-caps">AUTHOR</span><span class="italics">  of the</span><span class="all-caps">  FARCE</span><div class="speaker"></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Ere the curtain draws up, lift a little to me:</div><div class="l">Are you all in a very good humour?

The premise of the play is based on the character Menalcas that appears in Jean de La Bruyère’s Les Caractères de Théophraste traduits du grec avec Les Caractères ou les moeurs de ce siècle (English title: Characters, or the Manners of the Age: With the Moral Characters of Theophrastus). Menalcas appears in the seventh paragraph in the chapter titled “XI. Of Mankind.” The quarto in this digital edition contains a stamped title page, a dedication to the king (from William Griffin?), a preface, a prologue by the author of the play, a dramatis personae, and the two act play itself (and all of its dialogue, stage directions, and scene and act markers and changes). They play was performed by His Majesty’s Servants at the Theater Royal in Drury-Lane.</p></div><div class="appendix" id="index.xml-back.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">Appendix B </span><span class="head">The Project</span></h2><p>The Absent Man project was created as a collaborative effort between Andreas Bassett and Sarah Moore, under the direction of Dr. Geoff Turnovsky and the ENGL501 Textual Studies and Digital Editing course during the Autumn 2019 quarter at the University of Washington. Our project is a online critical edition of The Absent Man: A Farce, a 1768 theatrical adaptation of Jean de la Bruyère’s Les Charactères. Our project is designed to meet the needs of general reader, students, and researchers interested in engaging in an obscure work influenced by La Bruyère’s Les Charactères. This edition is informed by the idea of close reading and textual enfolding, that is, that meaning is created as a text reveals or obscures information. To that end, this digital project is built around the concept of curating selections of the text to interact with. Users can, for example, choose to only see dialogue spoken by specific characters, or focus on specific scenes. Users can also hide or reveal textual and critical notes. In this way, The Absent Man mimics the separate-but- related character sketches of Les Charactères.</p></div><div class="appendix" id="index.xml-back.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">Appendix C </span><span class="head">Development Team</span></h2><p><span class="persName">Andreas Bassett</span>is a second-year doctoral student at the University of Washington, Seattle where he studies early modern drama and medieval literature. His research interests include the Shakespeare apocrypha, print culture, bibliography, stylometry, the Matter of Britain, and some of the lesser-known dramatists of the Elizabethan era. At the moment Andreas is working on his master’s essay which traces, historicizes, and analyzes three apocryphal plays by the obscure “W. S.,” Locrine (1595), Thomas Lord Cromwell (1602), and The Puritan (1607), a tragedy, history, and comedy, respectively, as an independent and cohesive trilogy. He is also currently working on developing an authoritative digital edition of Nostradamus’ Les Prophecies.</p><p><span class="persName">Sarah Nickel Moore</span>is currently a doctorate student at the University of Washington, where she studies late medieval romance and early modern drama. She has an interest in the environmental humanities and the materiality of textual manuscripts, and as such several of her past projects have focused on the connections between animal, women, and text. Currently, Sarah is completing a certificate in textual studies, in which she is applying her knowledge of the material text to the creation of digital editions. She received her master’s degree from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, with thesis work that examined the animal and female bodies in The Avowyng of Arthur and Marie de France’s Yonec. Sarah continuously seeks to improve her pedagogy, and has repeatedly used her research as a means of sparking discussion in the classroom, where she aims to help students find their critical voices.</p></div><div class="appendix" id="index.xml-back.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">Appendix D </span><span class="head">Teaching Resources</span></h2><p>Forthcoming</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Isaac Bickerstaff.
