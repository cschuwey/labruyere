               and, in short, the happy day arrives, in which 
               he is to be put in possession of the amiable object; 
               when, behold you, the Doctor coming to call on his
               destined son-in-law, presto, pass and gone, the
               bird is flown; my gentleman is not to be found&emdash;

                  'tis granted, Sir, matrimony is without a doubt an
                  excellent remedy, in such distempers; a kind of 
                  manna and cream of tartat; a mixture of sweet
                  and <!--sower--> sour; wonderfully adapted to purge the mind

                  <p>Lord, Sir!, I could tell you such stories of 
                  him, as would make you credit this with very little 
                  difficulry&emdash;for instance, the other day, he was sitting
                  in a coffee-house, when a fly which had buzz'd
                  about him a good while, and he was watching an
                  oppertunity to kill, unluckily settled upon the cheek
                  of a person who stood near him&emdash;Ha! says he, I 
                  believe I have you now; and with that, Sir, he up
                  with his hand, and hit the poor gentleman such a 
                  confounded slap, as made the room ring again; one
                  started, the other stared, in short, swords were
                  drawn, and the cafe would infalliably have been
                  transferred to Hyde Park, had not the acquaintance
                  on both sides interposed; so he begged pardon, 
                  confessed he did not know what he was doing; it ended
                  in a hearty laugh, and the general astonishment of 
                  the whole company.</p></sp>

                  a lady, and a gentleman, i nhis bed-chamber here, 
                  in the way of a joke only; was call'd down about 
                  some business; forgot it by the time he came to the 
                  foot of the stairs, went our with the key in his 
                  pocket, and ti was six o'clock before we could set

                  <p>His ideas are so confused sometimes, Sir,
                  that I have known him write a letter to one person, 
                  direct it to another, and sent it to a third, who 
                  could not devise who it came from; because, he had

                  <p>But the best thing I have heard of him a 
                  goos while, was, what he did lately at a gentleman's 
                  house in the city; where taking his leave with an 
                  intention to go away; in one of his absent fits, he
                  mounted up three pair of stars into the garret; the
                  maids that by chance were ironing there, wonder'd 
                  what the plague kept such a stamping about the
                  rooms, when one of them taking a candle to see
                  what it was, found my poor paster; who, in the
                  utmost confusion, told her, he fancy'd he had made
                  some mistake, and begg'd to know if that was not
                  the way to the street door.</p></sp>

                  <p>Well, I don't know; but, if his present

                  be there presently with the writings; I have taken
                  out a licence; appointed the clergyman to come
                  and marry the; how shall I put it off after this,

                     beauty of the weather had <!--inticed-->enticed me as far as 
                     Putney, before I percieved that I was in t'other 
                     side the river; where, meeting with a party of friends
                     going to dine at Richmond, I made a fifth in their 
                     vehicle&emdash;by the way I was obliged to get one of the 
                     ladies to pay my reckoning&emdash;for when I came to put 
                     my hand in my pocket&emdash;the duce a farthing had I 
                     about me.</p></sp>

                     <p>No, that I will answer for&emdash;here is your 
                     purse, Sir, you left it on the hall table, last night, 
                     when you were discharging the chairman&emdash;and 
                     'twas very well I went down as I did, or ten to one 
                     but somebody might have whipped it away.</p></sp>

                     <p>But did not you talk of dressing? If you 
                     have any such intention, you had better do it 
                     speedily, and as you will be some little time about 
                     it, I will make use of the oppertunity to dispatch 
                     a few visits, which I must necessarily make this 
                     afternoon&emdash;you will come as soon as you are ready&emdash;
                     and believe me, when I assure you, I long to see you 
                     one of my family.</p></sp>
